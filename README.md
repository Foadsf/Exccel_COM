# Exccel_COM
Listing all COM objects exposed by Excel on Windows


Following [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/q/65013868/4999991), I searched for the ProgIDs including the term `Excel` and realised that there are several COM objects available:

* Application
* Chart
* OpenDocumentSpreadsheet
* Sheet
* SheetBinaryMacroEnabled
* SheetMacroEnabled

I exported all the methods and properties exposed by these objects.
